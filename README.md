# NinjaToCat
( jQuery )

jQuery puzzle using two images sliced into five parts.
 
Using jQuery, made it so that when each image slice is clicked, it will change to a different picture. 

Rule : If part of 'Picture A' shows 'Picture B' On click then after clicking again on 'Picture B' it should show 'Picture A' again
